# tl-platform-building-blocks

These deployment templates are used by the T-Level projects, at this time there is a transition
from the templates folder which is deprecated to the ARMTemplates folder which was pulled from
DFE-Digital/operations-devops-deployment to avoid having multiple parts of the organisation with
different cadances having to introduce overhead activity to coordinate changes.
